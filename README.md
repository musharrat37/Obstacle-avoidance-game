# Obstacle game 
This is an attempt at an obstacle game using the GLUT library (OpenGL Utility Toolkit). 
The objective of the game is to stay alive by avoiding obstacles which are the green squares and brown balls (appears in level 2). Using the left, right, up and down arrow buttons, the player can be moved across the screen to avoid the obstacles and collect the yellow objects to increase the life bar and score.
Each hit with an obstacle will cost life and the life bar at the top-left corner will indicate when life points are too low.
The game ends when life score becomes zero.

There are currently 2 levels to the game and it is still under development.
